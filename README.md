Overview: 
This course will review, as appropriate, the more familiar procedures covered in Psychology 252, namely, the general linear model (lm {stats} in R), the generalised linear model (glm {stats}), and linear mixed models (lme {nlme}, lmer {lme4}).  Also, we will consider less familiar applications of these R functions, and more ‘advanced’ procedures, such as, reliability, factor analysis, penalized regression, and structural equation modeling.
